    Scheduled downtime
   </a>
  </h2>
  <p>
   Our server will be under maintenance, so we can reorganize the way it is set up, upgrade our OS and fix stuff here and there

   <br/>
   We hope downtime will only be for tomorrow October 18th and the day after, the 19th but these things have a habit of going horribly wrong so no promises!
   <br/>
   Note that this includes our forum.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sorry for the inconvenience, but we hope the changes will make the site and forums faster and more efficient
