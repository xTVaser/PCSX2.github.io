   We're back!! Over the past three weeks you may of noticed that this site was nothing more than some panties with a BBL sign (didn't saqib's body look hawt
   <img alt="Very Happy" class="yvSmiley" height="20" src="https://pcsx2.net/images/stories/frontend/smilies/biggrin.gif" width="20"/>
   ) or a daft reference to PCSX3!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Well the old site was horribly broken and had a variety of flaws, so myself and the hardworking
   <strong>
    Falcon4ever
   </strong>
   ripped the site down to give you this new one! Voila! We hope you like.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A variety of new features and improvements have been impl4mented, I shall just list a few:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Compat list is paginated - reducing load, makes browsing faster to!
   </li>
   <li>
    Compat list is searchable!
   </li>
   <li>
    Greatly reduced load times
   </li>
   <li>
    No framesets - We all hated them, now they're no more!
   </li>
   <li>
    No Popups - No security warnings, flashier to behold, and neater.
   </li>
   <li>
    Clearer navigation, with multi tier menus, plain text navigation for easy translation!
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   One
   <strong>
    key
   </strong>
   feature is the return of the Donate button

   <br/>
   <br/>
   The site has full
   <strong>
    Firefox
   </strong>
   support, however there are some 'minor' flaws with IE at present (just making IE6 actually comply was fun enough!), which will be sorted very soon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Be sure you check out
   <em>
    Downloads&gt;Videos
   </em>
   for two new videos, and check there regularly for new footage!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   We now also have a working screenshots system on the sites Backend, we shall be running a mini competition on the forums for everyone to submit their 'sexiest' screenshot, the best shots will go into the sites screenshot section, with your name immortalized
   <img alt="Wink" class="yvSmiley" height="20" src="https://pcsx2.net/images/stories/frontend/smilies/wink.gif" width="20"/>
   More info on that soon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Finally a massive thanks to the testing team, the devs and poor old
