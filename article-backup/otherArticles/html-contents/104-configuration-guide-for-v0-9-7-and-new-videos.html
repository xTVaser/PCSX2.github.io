   I finally got around updating the now (huge) configuration guide for the new beta version of PCSX2 v0.9.7!

   We also revamped our video section with 11 new gameplay videos using 0.9.7 courtesy of yours truly, Shadow Lady, Rudy_X and rama. The downloads are available via torrents (click the download button on the right) which you can grab from our videos section

   . As usual please help us seed as much as possible!

   We will also consider accepting user created videos to host them on our torrent tracker in the future
