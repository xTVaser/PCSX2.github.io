   Im sure most of you have noticed recently the site has been slow, full of SQL errors and lord knows what.

   Well we noticed too! So we have now moved on to a nice new dedicated server, which should have less trouble handling the load (and give ngemu.com some breathing space). You might notice a couple of small problems for a few days as we iron things out but most things should be fully functional. Its not cheap (about $160 USD per month) so any help via the donation button at the bottom of the page would be appreciated!

   Sorry for the inconvenience caused and i hope everything is much better for you all from here on in! A big thank you to Falcon4ever for working so hard to get everything across. You've done a marvelous job.
