   As you all can see development has been sluggish after the huge 1.0.0 release (as it always happens after releases) but there are still new stuff to look out for. So since the release of 1.0.0 here is a breakdown of most of the changes on PCSX2 itself and its plugins:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Various SPU2-X fixes for crashes/hanging in some games
   </li>
   <li>
    Snowblind engine fix (Baldur's Gate etc) which also fixed Mortal Kombat Shaolin Monks. Keep in mind Baldur's Gate games only work in software mode for now and with various bugs still (we are getting there...)
   </li>
   <li>
    Adapter selector in GSdx so you can select your dedicated graphics card instead of that pesky on board graphics chip
   </li>
   <li>
    Videos finally working for Katamari Damacy, Baldur's Gate, Tales of Destiny 2, Suikoden Tactics, Midnight Club,Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus, Ace Combat games and probably many more
   </li>
   <li>
    Various fixes here and there
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   The website also got its share of fixes, with various layout fixes, a much nicer looking video gallery under Demo, random screenshot on index page really random (
   <img alt="Razz" class="yvSmiley" height="20" src="https://pcsx2.net/images/stories/frontend/smilies/tongue.gif" width="20"/>
   ) and more functionality on the compatibility list. I am planning on adding some very handy features to it soon, which are still under development but I'm sure most will appreciate them!

   Our community has also been very active, with many members coding tools and patches for PCSX2 which are worth a mention:
