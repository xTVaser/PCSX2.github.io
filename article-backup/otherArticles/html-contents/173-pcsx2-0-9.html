   Yes folks
   <strong>
    PCSX2 0.9
   </strong>
   is here, by no means gracefully, but it is here!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   You can now enjoy
   <strong>
    PCSX2 0.9
   </strong>
   a faster and more compatible PS2 emulator, it's been a year since
   <em>
    0.8.1
   </em>
   was released so you will see many dramatic changes!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many games are now going ingame, and some are even playable (check out games like Disgaea, or Silent Hill 4!)
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On behalf of all the team I would like to say a big
   <strong>
    HELLO
   </strong>
   to linuzappz, and a large thank you for everything he's done for us prior to him leaving the team!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Given the site troubles over the past 24 hours, I can assure you that myself and several devs right now are totally bald from ripping our hair out!

   <br/>
   <br/>
   Thus the download is being hosted off site, and some aspects of the site may still be broken, we're working on this, but please give us some time!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    NOTE: There will be no Linux build for a good few weeks! so apologies to all linux users!
   </strong>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    NOTE: PLEASE READ THE HELP FILE BEFORE RUNNING PCSX2!
   </strong>

   <strong>
    IF YOU DOWNLOADED BEFORE 03/04/06 13:15 GMT PLEASE REDOWNLOAD
   </strong>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   Until the site is working properly again we cannot host it locally, so use either of these 2 mirrors:
   <br/>
   <a href="/download/viewcategory/21-pcsx2-v0-9.html">
    Mirror 1
   </a>
   <a href="http://pcsx2.net">
