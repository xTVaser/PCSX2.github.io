    PCSX2 0.9.7 beta released!
   </a>
  </h2>
  <p>
   After more than a year since the last stable 0.9.6 release and 8 months since the last beta release of PCSX2, the new beta version is finally ready!
   <br/>
   The most notable change is the all new GUI powered by wxWidgets, but the amount of improvements in this release is really amazing

   <br/>
   <br/>
   This 0.9.7 release is marked as unstable/beta, meaning it still has some known bugs and unimplemented features but it is fully supported by the PCSX2 team. For more info, check the included readme file.
