    PCSX2
   </strong>
   has made its second appearance in the Italian magazine -
   <em>
    The Games Machine
   </em>
   . It's great to see PCSX2 getting mention in publications, and we thought we'd share the article with you!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   If you can read Italian, you can click on the thumbnail to the left and read it yourself, for those of you who can't read Italian, a rough translation is below (Made by a friend of the PCSX2 team!):
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <em>
    "Some time ago we talked about PS2 emulation and we mentioned that PCSX2 had made a lot of progress, but that it was still impossible to "play".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Things have changed a lot and now PCSX2, that is the result of more than 2 years of developing, is the only emulator that can emulate the PS2 in a good way. The hardware requirements are very high, we are talking about an Intel E6600 or an equivalent AMD, 1 GB of ram and a video card with full support of Pixel Shader 2.0.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The requirements are very high but not absurd if you are thinking a bout an upgrade to Windows Vista. PCSX2, the latest release 0.9.2, is based on some plugins which emulate the functions of PCSX2.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    On the official site of the project (
    <a href="http://pcsx2.net">
     http://pcsx2.net
    </a>
    ) you can find a very complete guide to the use of the emu. Personally, I can recommend you the new ZeroGS 0.96.0 (a video plugin). It's a plugin which works very well only with newer graphics cards. There are specific plugins just for audio,controller, USB and for Firewire emulation. There are also a lot of CDVD plugins.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you want to use PCSX2 you must have a "real ps2" and its bios. You can obtain it dumping it from your ps2 (any other way is against the law).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    PCSX2 is compatible with a lot of famous games like: GTA San Andreas, Devil May Cry 3, Final Fantasy X... The framerate is very low on a lot of PC's but buying a very powerful pc, the framerate problem is going to end in the coming months.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    At the end PCSX2 is a very good product and it'll have for sure an evolution thanks to the hardware evolution."
