   Thanks to some recent work by
   <em>
    Refraction
   </em>
   and a new contributor
   <em>
    ZeroFrog
   </em>
   , we can now walk around the first demo area of this game. Given this is
   <strong>
    VERY
   </strong>
   early work in progress (W.I.P), there are some major bugs to be ironed out, like various graphical issues!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However to celebrate this breakthrough, there is a video and several screens, and be sure to check out the official forums for some up-and-coming new shots, progress and general discussion!

   <strong>
    AVI
   </strong>
