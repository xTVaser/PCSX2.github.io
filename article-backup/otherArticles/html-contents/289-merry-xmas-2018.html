   Merry Christmas everyone! We know you haven't heard from us for a while (ok for a long time
   <img alt="Razz" class="yvSmiley" height="20" src="https://pcsx2.net/images/stories/frontend/smilies/tongue.gif" width="20"/>
   ) but it was for good reason!

  <p>
   Development has been going strong for several months with some new members joining and others digging even deeper in PCSX2 issues ironing them out. People who have been following our
   <a href="https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
    github
   </a>
   already know how many hacks have been removed (yes, removed
   <img alt="Razz" class="yvSmiley" height="20" src="https://pcsx2.net/images/stories/frontend/smilies/tongue.gif" width="20"/>
   ) lately, with the DX11 renderer of GSdx quickly catching up to OpenGL accuracy levels thanks to several contributors. This large boost in progress was incited by gregory helping out the newcomers with his in-depth knowledge of GSdx, in between his baby's sleep sessions, so he deserves a big thank you from all of us. The core has also been improved, while several big PRs are also close to merging, making this an exciting time for PCSX2!
  </p>

   Thanks to the new (and old) guys giving their time and skills to breathe some life to PCSX2 and to everyone who still believe in us and appreciate this project! Have a nice one and keep playing!
