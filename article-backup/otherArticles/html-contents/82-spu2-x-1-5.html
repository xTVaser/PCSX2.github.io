    SPU2-X 1.5!
   </a>
  </h2>
  <p>
   Hey guys,
   <br/>
   In light of recent fixes and additions we prepared a new SPU2-X release for you
   <img alt="Smile" class="yvSmiley" height="20" src="https://pcsx2.net/images/stories/frontend/smilies/smile.gif" width="20"/>
  </p>

   <br/>
   This one focuses on SPU2 emulation accuracy but there's also the much requested volume adjustment feature included.
   <br/>
   You can now try a fake SPU2 reverb mode that may sound better than the (still somewhat broken) original reverb.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Emulation improvements:
   <br/>
   - Reverb engine reviewed and mostly rewritten.
   <br/>
   - Initialization modified to reflect test results, including a critical portion of the BIOS initialization sequence to support fast boot.
   <br/>
   - Hardware reset feature removed because tests failed to prove its existence.
   <br/>
   - Possible null pointer access eliminated.
   <br/>
   - Added support for reading KON and KOF registers, which is used in the BIOS.
   <br/>
   - Improved voice loop logic based on tests.
   <br/>
   - Constantly mix the input area and generate IRQs from accessing it.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among the fixed games are titles such as:
   <br/>
   - F1 2005
   <br/>
   - Burnout in-game music
   <br/>
   - Tomb Raider (the whole series)
   <br/>
   - Spyro the Dragon
   <br/>
   - Gauntlet Dark Legacy
   <br/>
   - Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver 2
   <br/>
   - etc
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hope you enjoy, and please report all (new) bugs if you find them!
