    New PCSX2 0.9.7 beta (r3878)!
   </a>
  </h2>
  <p>
   Hey people,
   <br/>
   today we make the second 0.9.7 beta release available: PCSX2 0.9.7 (r3878)!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 0.9.7 series is marked as unstable/beta, meaning it still has some known bugs
   <br/>
   and unimplemented features but it is fully supported by the PCSX2 team.
   <br/>
   We've spent the last months on various aspects of the emulator, adding to the awesome progress seen in beta 1.
   <br/>
   This release has been compiled with extensive optimizations, so you can expect a small speedup over r3113

   <br/>
   <br/>
   Here's some of the changes:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Gui work: threading, layout and stability have been improved.
   </li>
   <li>
    Some of the reported .ini writing issues should be fixed now.
   </li>
   <li>
    Game database: bug fixes, more entries, compatibility hints for pcsx2.
   </li>
   <li>
    Automated patching enabled now: known fixes/settings for some games can be enabled automatically.
   </li>
   <li>
    Emulation fixes to microVU.
   </li>
   <li>
    VIF/GIF work: Slightly faster and more compatible.
   </li>
   <li>
    Much work on GIFPath ordering issues. many games with previously flickering textures should work better.
   </li>
   <li>
    IPU retooled and optimized: A bit faster, a bit more compatible and much more sane (no more coroutines).
   </li>
   <li>
    Removed hazardous MMX/XMMregister freeze/restore. Speedup and stability is improved.
   </li>
   <li>
    Savestates are now free of memory leaks.
   </li>
   <li>
    Disk swapping works on a few games now (not all yet though).
   </li>
   <li>
    New "fast CDVD" speedhack. Load levels as fast as possible!
   </li>
   <li>
    Console logging is now configurable to be as verbose as in developer builds.
   </li>
   <li>
    Commandline support.
   </li>
   <li>
    A lot of other small tweaks and additions.
   </li>
  </ul>
