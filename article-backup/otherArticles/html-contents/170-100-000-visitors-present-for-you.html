   With

   unique visitors having visited this site in it's short time online (13 days), both myself and
   <em>
    Falcon4ever
   </em>
   are happy it's gone so smoothly.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   So a video of
   <em>
    Makai Kingdom
   </em>
   in action has been recorded for you lot to download and enjoy, including audio (speech, music, sound effects).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   So you are thinking
   <strong>
    woopiee
   </strong>
   a video, wow, that's shocking...

   , well hold that thought, what if I told you that the video only had to be sped up by about 10 FPS to get to 60 FPS, e.g. what you see is practically what it's emulated at!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   What?!! near full speed emulation?!! impossible I hear you cry, well I did tell you that
   <strong>
    zerofrog
   </strong>
   was re-writing the eeREC and vuREC
   <img alt="Wink" class="yvSmiley" height="20" src="https://pcsx2.net/images/stories/frontend/smilies/wink.gif" width="20"/>
   There's a lot to do, as in all honesty
   <em>
    many
   </em>
   games got broken with bugs during the transition from the old rec, to the new, but he's still not blinking, and he is avoiding sleep, so hopefully more news eventually!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Enough of that for now, enjoy the video, which you can grab on
