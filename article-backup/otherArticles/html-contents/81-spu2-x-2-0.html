    SPU2-X 2.0!
   </a>
  </h2>
  <p>
   Not even 2 weeks ago we released SPU2-X 1.5, yet today we feel that the plugin has matured enough for another release.
   <br/>
   This time the changes are significant enough to do the version jump to 2.0

   <br/>
   <br/>
   SPU2-X always struggled to get the reverberation effects right.
   <br/>
   Now after some thorough debugging we've found and fixed the problem we had all this time!
   <br/>
   The resulting reverb is still not exactly like the PS2 does it but it comes very close in perceived quality.
   <br/>
   We'll be working on those final bits in the time to come, hopefully achieving a fully correct emulation one day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Note: The custom reverb option has been removed as it no longer serves a purpose.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Emulation improvements:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Next address reporting on voices improved based on tests.
   </li>
   <li>
    Pitch modulation possibly fixed.
   </li>
   <li>
    Status register updated in a way the spu2 library's reset function seems to want.
   </li>
   <li>
    Effects area updating changed to allow writing the EEA register while effects area writing is enabled.
   </li>
   <li>
    Switched two SPDIF modes which were reversed.
   </li>
   <li>
    Reverb register bug dating back to the first version of SPU2-X fixed.
   </li>
  </ul>
