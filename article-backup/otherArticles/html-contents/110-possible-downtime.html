    Possible Downtime
   </a>
  </h2>
  <p>
   Hey there guys,
  </p>
  <p>
   <br/>
   Just to let you all know, during the next 7 days there may be a bit of downtime due to us moving our domain registration over from directnic to the company our dedicated server is owned by, thus bringing everything in to one place for easier management (from our perspective).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Apologies in advance for any inconvenience, however the main website and the forums will be down during this period, but we will try our best to get the website back up as soon as we can!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Thanks
   <br/>

   </strong>
   : The domain is now across, the main site seems ok however the forums DNS record isnt working currently, we are working on this.
   <br/>
   For now you can add this to your hosts file located in c:\windows directory\system32\drivers\etc
   <br/>

   This should give you access again until we get this fixed.

   Happy April Fools Day! (btw this isnt an april fool)
