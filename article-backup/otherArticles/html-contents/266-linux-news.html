   Hello guys, here are some news on the Linux front. Yes I know, I ought to do that more regularly
   <img alt="Razz" class="yvSmiley" height="20" src="https://pcsx2.net/images/stories/frontend/smilies/tongue.gif" width="20"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In short progress is slow but steady

   * A port to wxWidget 3.0 was done recently, mostly because Debian will drop wxWidget 2.8 . It is enabled by default but wx2.8 is still there, you can restore is with the -DWX28_API=TRUE build option.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Most of regressions were fixed so it will work as bad as before
    <img alt="Wink" class="yvSmiley" height="20" src="https://pcsx2.net/images/stories/frontend/smilies/wink.gif" width="20"/>
    No I'm kidding, it actually works better on my PC. Feel free to test it.
   </li>
   <li>
    Unfortunately Windows is still blocked to wx2.8,
    <span style="color: #1e90ff;">
     contributions are welcome (first step is to add a wx3.0 library build)
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    Some wxWidget libraries depend on GTK3. PCSX2 code was updated to support GTK3 but wxWidget is not as stable as expected. Nevertheless, you can enable GTK3 with the -DGTK3_API=TRUE build option (debug build only).
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   <br/>
   * Better support of cross-building (thanks to Micove). Cmake used to select wrong libraries between lib32/lib64/lib/...
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    You need to use this new option on 64 bits machines -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/linux-compiler-i386-multilib.cmake
   </li>
   <li>
    Note: build.sh will do it by default, so just build.sh
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   <br/>
   * Support of AVX
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    code is now compiled with -march=native to support all optimizations of your CPU. It can be disabled with the -DISABLE_ADVANCE_SIMD=TRUE build option (for example distribution or inside VM)
   </li>
   <li>
    Note: GSdx (Linux) needs a couple of updates to support SSE4x.
    <span style="color: #1e90ff;">
     Again contributions are welcome

   * New (nearly) playable game: Bouken Jidai Katsugeki Goemon
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Full support of MMU with the interpreter, and a dedicated game-fix for the recompiler
   </li>
   <li>
    No more TLB misses! (full story will be posted in
    <a href="/developer-blog.html" target="_blank">

    </a>
    in coming weeks).
   </li>
   <li>
    Crashes are reported on GSdx windows not sure on Linux.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   <br/>
   * Finally, Ubuntu PPA is up to date with the latest feature. However, Ubuntu 12.04 support is discontinued!
  </p>
  <hr/>

   <br/>
   Ongoing work (aka the plan for the next months):
   <br/>
   <br/>
   * port lilypad to Linux
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    It will bring Force Feedback, MultiTap and it might work better in several games.
   </li>
   <li>
    I'm close to have keyboard support
    <span style="color: #1e90ff;">
     but help would be appreciated to build a full GUI. Please contact us if you are interested.
    </span>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   * port GSdx to openGL 4.5
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    A long time ago, I planned to update the code to support GL_ARB_direct_state_access. It was postponed because no official driver supported it.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <hr/>
  <p>

   Last but not least, thanks to all contributors. Even the smallest patches are a big help.
