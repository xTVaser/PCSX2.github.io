    Linuzappz
   </strong>
   the lead coder for the
   <em>
    PCSX2
   </em>
   project has 'officially' quit. This is due to several reasons, from slowly losing interest in the project, to simply not having enough time to work on it.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   I won't pull punches here, this
   <em>
    is
   </em>
   a major blow to this project as he is responsible for so much code, plugins and has an extensive knowledge of the
   <strong>
    PlayStation 2
   </strong>
   . Whilst he will pop in 'rarely' to lend a hand, or some advice he won't be working on it further

   <br/>
   <br/>
   All of the betatesting team, his fellow developers and the general people who lend help in
   <strong>
    #PCSX2
   </strong>
   will greatly miss him. We send him all our best, wish him luck with his hectic life and lets hope he gets at least one date with
   <strong>

   <strong>
    PCSX2
   </strong>
   is far from dead and both
   <strong>

   </strong>
   ,
   <strong>
    Saqib
   </strong>
   will maintain the project with the heap of coders we do have (Refraction, auMatt, GoldFinger etc..)

   Given this project has come so far just recently we won't be letting it go the way of the dodo.
