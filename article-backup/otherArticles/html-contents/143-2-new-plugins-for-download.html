   Okay, they aren't new, they have been on NGemu a while, but they have been getting some good support from the community and i felt they needed adding to the official site!!

   <br/>
   Due to the hard work of
   <strong>
    Rebel_X
   </strong>
   and
   <strong>
    ChickenLiver
   </strong>
   from the PCSX2 forums, we are proud to present
   <strong>
    LilyPad
   </strong>
   and
   <strong>
    TwinPad
   </strong>
   plugins, which both allow keyboard users to have full use of the analog sticks! I'm sure you will enjoy them as much as the forum users have.
