   Since its summer time and nothing much goes on these days (yes the devs and testers also have lives!) I thought I'd entertain you with some videos I recorded, showing off some of the new fixes in 0.9.4.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   First and foremost, you'll notice perfect sound in both Dynasty Warriors 4 Xtreme Legends and Fullmetal Alchemist 2 videos! Also, Fullmetal Alchemist 2 did not even boot in 0.9.3 but with the SPU2 fixes in 0.9.4 the game looks playable and I've already reached Chapter 2 with no problems at all.Note that the videos were taken using Bilinear filtering and 4X AA and are sped up to 100% speed although they did run pretty near that thanks to the new ZeroGS!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   About progress I'll just say there are some new plugins in development which have only seen null versions of until now, zeroGS 16:9 support and the new bios format getting implemented (still not complete)
   <br/>
   <br/>
   All three videos were recorded using the XVID codec, so you'll need that to play them back.
   <br/>
   Also you'll need a bittorent client such as
   <a href="http://www.utorrent.com" target="_blank">
    uTorrent
   </a>
   to download the videos!

   Please seed for as long as possible! Oh and have some nice summer vacations
