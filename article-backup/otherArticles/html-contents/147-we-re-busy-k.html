   <em>
    Busy
   </em>
   is certainly one way to describe PCSX2 development currently!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Progress on
   <strong>
    PCSX2 0.9.4
   </strong>
   is coming along nicely with several members of the team making some significant additions to the project!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    Zerofrog
   </strong>
   has fixed the SPS (Spikey Polygon Syndrome) that plagued
   <em>
    Kingdom Hearts 2
   </em>
   , making the game much more viewable and
   <strong>
    almost
   </strong>
   playable!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   To demonstrate this, below are 10
   <strong>
    High Quality
   </strong>
   shots from various areas of the game, but take special note when viewing the images...why?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   ZeroGS development has also continued during this hectic time, and those of you with great GPU's can enjoy 8x and 16x render target (referred to as AA within the plugin).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Also head on over to our

   </a>
   section to get a video of
   <em>
    Kingdom Hearts 2
   </em>
   being played! Video is provided as a torrent so
   <strong>
    please
   </strong>
   seed!

   <strong>
    Saqib
   </strong>
   has recently been working hard on memory card issues, testing is still under way however thanks to his work games like
   <em>
    Phantasy Star Universe
   </em>
   are now getting ingame and the ever popular
   <em>
    Resident Evil 4
   </em>
   can now load saves, and if all goes to plan - save to!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    Refraction
   </strong>
   is also busy and after his success with
   <strong>
    Path 3
   </strong>
   work has turned his attention to other issues, thanks to his work
   <em>
    Tekken 5
   </em>
   is now getting ingame! Currently
   <em>
    Tekken 5
   </em>
   can't be classed as playable as characters are totally lacking in the Y dimension!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Plenty more where all this came from...watch this space!
