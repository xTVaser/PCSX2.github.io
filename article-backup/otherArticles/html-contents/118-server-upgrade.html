    Server upgrade
   </a>
  </h2>
  <p>
   On July 25th, we will be performing maintenance to our dedicated server. The server will be taken down at 11:00 CET. This means that the frontend and the forums will be offline.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Scheduled tasks:
   <br/>
   - Site backup (This could take a couple of hours)
   <br/>
   - Fresh install of Ubuntu (This could take a couple of hours)
   <br/>
   - Restore the forums (less than one hour)
   <br/>
   - Restore the frontend (less than one hour)
   <br/>
   <br/>
   If no problems occur, the server should be back online at the end of the day (CET).
   <br/>

   <br/>
   And we're back online!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It took a bit longer than expected (blame ref

   ) but hopefully everything is working now.
