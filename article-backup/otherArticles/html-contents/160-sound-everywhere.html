   In the
   <strong>
    Good News for 0.9.2!
   </strong>
   post, made on 16th August, Refraction hinted at progress being made with the audio side of PCSX2, as many of you will of guessed - the clip posted was from
   <strong>
    Final Fantasy X
   </strong>
   , more importantly from an FMV, which in all previous versions of PCSX2 had no audio (99% of the time).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   To elaborate on this further;
   <strong>
    GiGaHeRz
   </strong>
   and
   <strong>
    Saqib
   </strong>
   have fixed large portions of
   <em>
    ADMA
   </em>
   support, allowing for
   <em>
    all
   </em>
   videos to have audio and many games now have full background music!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A little work has been done by
   <strong>
    Saqib
   </strong>
   today which allows for audio and video sync when recording, so I can demonstrate with a small video (xVid) - the results of their hard work.
