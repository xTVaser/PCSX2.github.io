   one of our long serving betatesters has been having 'fun' testing
   <em>
    Biohazard 4 (Resident Evil 4)
   </em>
   under the WIP PCSX2 0.9 beta. Whilst there are still many issues with this game, such as a lack of memory card detection, it is fully playable, and looking utterly gorgeous at high res.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This video is a
   <strong>
    WMV
   </strong>
   and should be playable under any decent media player and is being shared using
   <strong>
    Bit Torrent
   </strong>
   , thus you will need a Bit Torrent client such as
   <a href="http://azureus.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">
    Azureus
   </a>
   to get this video!

   Biohazard 4 - Ingame
   <br/>
   3 Minutes 16 Seconds | 24.1MB | Real Ingame Speed - 10 FPS.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   !! The video was recorded through
   <strong>
    GSdx
   </strong>
   which automatically speeds up video, so you are
   <em>
    NOT
   </em>
   watching actual emulated speeds! The real FPS is shown under the video link! Given that this video is being shared through Bit Torrent, we ask if you could seed (share) this file for as long as possible!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Enjoy the video!
