   Hey everyone,
   <br/>
   <br/>
   We just moved the PCSX2 version control system from SVN over to GIT.
   <br/>
   The new official source code repository is hosted on GitHub.
   <br/>
   You can find the source code
   <a href="https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">
    here
   </a>
   .
   <br/>
   And the new issue tracker
   <a href="https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/issues" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">
    here
   </a>
   .
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Git is more contributor friendly than SVN. The process of sending patches to a team member for eventual review has been streamlined.
   <br/>
   Now people can just fork the master repository, add their changes and open a pull request if they think it's good. The devs can then merge the request and the code is live.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This change is a pretty big operation, so please excuse (and report) any issues you find while we're transferring

  </p>
  <p>
   Keep in mind the build bot will take some time to update to the new source code repository, whenever Orphis can get around to it so until then, be patient!
