   Current WIP on the PCSX2 0.9.2 beta has led to the PAL (SCES 5049x) version of Final Fantasy X being
   <strong>
    Playable
   </strong>
   . Thanks to a variety of fixes made by various members of the team, including;
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    MTGS / DC mode stability - Great for Dual Core / CPU users!
   </li>
   <li>
    IPU fixes, including fully working sound in videos
   </li>
   <li>
    Pause and sync issues, no more random hangs, looping etc
   </li>
   <li>
    SPU2 fixes, including ADMA, and timing related issues.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   With MTGS (Multi Threaded GS) / DC (Dual Core) features gaining improved stability, the game can be played at 'enjoyable' speeds, ranging from a base speed of 29 FPS in the most intense areas, right up to the peak speeds of over 140 FPS.[1]
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This means that the US, Japanese and
   <em>
    finally
   </em>
   the European versions of Final Fantasy X are fully playable!
   <br/>
