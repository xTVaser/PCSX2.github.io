   It has been a year and a half since our first major release and as promised we decided PCSX2 has progressed enough for yet another stable release. Needless to say, we have been continuing our hard work since then to further improve the emulator, adding new features and fixing more bugs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As I'm sure many of you have been following the SVN revisions and have noticed the changes we have made in this time and many of you even assisted in finding problems for us to fix, so a big thank you to all those who helped out!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One big change in this release is the integration of the wide screen patches made by the community for the community numbering nearly 1200 games patched to support proper 16:9 aspect ratio. A huge thanks to everyone who has contributed for this and keep up the great job
