   Hey everyone,this isn't anything exciting but I just wanted to let you know.
   <br/>
   Our download section has finally been brought up to date with all the updated versions of the GS and Pad plugins which are under development.
   <br/>
   Also,some outdated and useless files have been removed to prevent confusion.
   <br/>
   I've also updated our sourceforge page (
   <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pcsx2/">
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/pcsx2/)
   </a>
   with the current info (it was last updated about 3 years ago!),added some screenshots and both FAQ - readme docs in the documentation section.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In other (more interesting for you) news,development is going good as you're able to see from the frequent SVN updates,with Refraction making the usual core changes,with a recent one giving a huge speed boost in some games (albeit breaking some,still trying to figure out what to do with that).
   <br/>
   Saqib is also working on something behind the scenes,wait and see when it's done
