    PCSX2 Used in Test:
   </strong>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The first is a mention from our friends at Eurogamer and Kotaku! PCSX2 was used in an experiment to see what ICO and Shadow of the Colossus would be like if they were re-released on the PS3 in HD (Note, they did NOT use the PS3's upscaling ability

   ), Check out these articles below.
