   After a really long period of silence, we're back with a bang!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Today we are announcing the release of
   <strong>
    PCSX2 Playground 1.0.0395
   </strong>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Born as a 'playground' test-bed for PCSX2 modifications and code, the Playground project evolved into much more, over a period of about 4 months.
   <br/>
   Created by Air (aka Jake Stine), arcum42, cottonvibes, drkIIRaziel, rama and tested by Krakatos, the team would like to thank:
   <br/>
   <br/>
   - Thanks to the original PCSX2 development team, to the betatesters and to everyone that helped them. Without their work, PCSX2 would not exist, and neither would the Playground project!
   <br/>
   - Thanks to the PCSX2 team once more for graciously hosting our forums.
   <br/>
   - Thanks to the PCSX2 team once again for providing hosting space

   <br/>
   - Thanks to Gigaherz for the render used in the playground logo
   <br/>
   - Thanks to all the people who tried the various Playground revisions over these months, providing us with helpful feedback
   <br/>
   - Thanks to everyone else who supported Playground, without you all this would have not been possible!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The PCSX2 team decided to support this project by having the official beta testers also test it and hosting their binary and forum, since they've been doing some great job
