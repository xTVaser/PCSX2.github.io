    PCSX2 plugins update for Windows!
   </a>
  </h2>
  <p>
   Hey guys!
   <br/>
   We've made some important changes to
   <strong>
    GSdx
   </strong>
   and
   <strong>
    SPU2-X
   </strong>
   concerning bugfixes, stability, and emulation correctness. It's best to use these with the PCSX2 0.9.7.r3113 beta release.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Head over to the
   <a href="/download/viewcategory/35-pcsx2-v0-9-7-beta.html">
    <strong>
     beta downloads section
    </strong>
   </a>
   to grab the 7z archive with the upgraded plugins. To upgrade, extract into your PCSX2 plugins folder and then select them from PCSX2's plugin selector.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   GSdx changes:

    Stability fixes and preparation work for future PCSX2 revisions.
   </li>
   <li>
    Finally fixed the remaining DirectX 11 memory leaks on emulator suspends!
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   SPU2-X changes:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Major bugfix that prevented SPU2-X from initializing on many users systems.
   </li>

    More accurate emulation regarding double interrupts.
   </li>
   <li>
    Fixed minor volume issues and doubled output volume.
   </li>

    <br/>
    Now the Tales of Destiny 2 sound test has a working visual equalizer.
   </li>
   <li>
    Mostly fixed voice modulation (used in Romancing Saga and FFX battles).
   </li>
   <li>
    Clamp illegal pitch settings, fixing another bunch of games.
