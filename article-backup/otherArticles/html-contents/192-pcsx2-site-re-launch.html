    PCSX2
   </strong>
   has been running for over three years now, and it was high time this project got a new site design! Well here it is! We hope you like

   The site now has a much improved
   <strong>
    compatibility
   </strong>
   section, which is continuously updated. Currently it shows what you can expect from the future 0.9 release. So far only 250 games have been entered, out of the 500 or so we do test! Check back regularly!

   <strong>
    Downloads
   </strong>
   have been made clearer, and the site now has a fresh
   <strong>
    screenshots
   </strong>
   section, where the
   <em>
    best
   </em>
   shots will be posted. Many other things have been added, so please browse around and explore!

   The site was designed by
   <strong>
    CKemu
   </strong>
   and coded by
   <strong>
    Falcon4ever
   </strong>
   . We would both like to thank the developers, beta testers and our host Bobbi for their help and support. An apology from myself, for putting up "..is dead!" - sorry if I scared any of you

   The site isn't technically complete yet. Whilst all parts function, there is much more to do, but both myself and
   <strong>
    Falcon4ever
   </strong>
   are pressed for time, so we shall work on it whilst the site is public!
