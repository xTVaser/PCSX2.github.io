    Scheduled downtime
   </a>
  </h2>
  <p>
   Tomorrow we will be working on the server which means that there will be some downtime. We're planning to change our OS and upgrading some software.
  </p>
  <p>
   <br/>
   There isn't an exact timeline but probably around noon we will start creating some backups and in the afternoon start with installing the OS. If no problems occur, we should be back sometime in the evening (CET).

   - Apologies for the downtime of today. We had to solve some issues regarding the database and forums. The problem has been fixed which should result in faster page loading on the forums (especially the General Discussion section).
