   I'm proud to announce our first 60 FPS youtube video (and possibly the first 60 FPS Kingdom Hearts 2 video on the internet), after 60 FPS videos got enabled a couple of days ago. The gameplay has been recorded with the 60 FPS patch from our forum members and at 6x native resolution. It's not as smooth as the original file, but still you can finally see how lovely it looks on PCSX2 without frame dropping!
   <strong>
    All our youtube videos from now on will be 50/60 FPS!
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Keep in mind that for now, 60 FPS videos only work on Google Chrome!
   </strong>

   The past weeks I've been working on upgrading our website to the latest version of Joomla and on the way decided to also redesign it as I didn't like how it ended up last time. I've already used many of the ideas posted in the last redesign thread on our forum, I've fixed a few stuff that were buggy, reduced both CSS and javascript and finally got themes working

   It's still pretty bad code wise but I've done my best to improve it and will keep at it.

  <p>
   I'm not sure when it will be done, but it might be synchronized with a server wide upgrade of our linux OS as well, to reduce downtime.

   After the main page is done, I will move on to updating mybb to the latest 1.8 version, although I'm still waiting for the software to be mature. 1.8 was extremely buggy, 1.8.1 is better but still not good enough so I hope with the next 1.8.2 release I will be able to start working on it (and a new custom theme it seems

   Edit: Uploaded new video, this should be with the 60 FPS patch on, sorry guys
