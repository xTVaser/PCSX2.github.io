   has once again been working on PCSX2, and has managed to fix the once present 'holes' in the terrain models of
   <em>
    Final Fantasy X
   </em>
   , making the game look excellent. This fix also has a wide range of effects on other games, so don't worry folks there will be news soon which doesn't involve a
   <em>
    Final Fantasy
   </em>
   !

   Whilst the game certainly now looks beautiful, it's still not playable from start to finish, due to various 'looping' issues and video playback, speed is of course an issue with such a complex emulation task, but will be improved upon in the future, keep watching this space!

   To celebrate this bit of progress, we have a large selection of screenshots, and one of the sexiest videos I've recorded from PCSX2 in awhile
