   Sorry about the long silence folks. I know most of you must be wondering what's going on these days and wondering where has everyone gone. Some of you already know I've been busy with moving from the US to the UK and this has kept me quite busy with sorting out visas and then with the actual move. Of course, once I made it, I was far from being able to put much time aside to be active again. I had a marriage to prepare for!

   Well, I'm happy to say that I am now married to a certain lady some of you may know as Raefraction. She is the sister of refraction, and so this now makes me his brother in law. Odd as it may seem, PCSX2 became a gateway to something more than I could have ever imagined. It's led me to my beautiful wife and great new family. I'm not sure if this is a first for emulation, but I'm sure anyone would be hard pressed to find another example quite like this.

   All that said, I'm working my way towards getting back into the swing of things. I've still got just a few more quirks to work out, but the bulk of it is done. I'm also planning on egging on my new brother in law to get back into this with me as well. Give us just a bit more time, and I'll see what I can do. Thanks for bearing with us while things have been busy in our every day lives.

   For those interested, you can see pictures from the wedding (which include myself, refraction, Raefraction and family) at General Emulation.

   Also there is a video I've uploaded to youtube of the ceremony. Keep in mind that due to their 10 minute limits for videos, I've had to separate it into two parts, which you can view in the above post as well. Thanks again, and I'll be back soon.
