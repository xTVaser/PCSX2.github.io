   Work has never stopped since the release of
   <strong>
    PCSX2 0.9.1
   </strong>
   , in fact it rarely does

   Refraction has made significant fixes to counters making games much more stable. For instance,
   <em>
    Final Fantasy X-2
   </em>
   is now stable enough to be classed as "playable". Disgaea will play story scenes without freezing, and Resident Evil 4 is much more stable during gameplay!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Saqib has been bustling away with IPU and more and more games are playing videos without looping or crashing mid-way through playback. This fixes games such as Grand Theft Auto III, Final Fantasy X and WipEout Fusion.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Zerofrog, busy as ever, has been fixing vuREC0/1 issues and making those games that do go 'Ingame' look correct including: Rayman M, Silent Hill 2, and a personal favorite
   <strong>
    WipEout Fusion
   </strong>
   .
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Saqibs IPU fixes combined with ZeroFrogs work on the graphical issues (I bugged him to death about this game
   <img alt="Razz" class="yvSmiley" height="20" src="https://pcsx2.net/images/stories/frontend/smilies/tongue.gif" width="20"/>
   ) have made
   <strong>
    WipEout Fusion
   </strong>
   playable! So head to the
