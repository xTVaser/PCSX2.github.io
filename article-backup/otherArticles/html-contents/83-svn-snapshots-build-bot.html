   Hey people, I thought this was worth mentioning

   Orphis was so kind to set up and operate a build bot for PCSX2 SVN snapshots.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The bot takes the latest sources as we commit them and builds working packages for you to download.
   <br/>
   These packages are /trunk builds and Win32 only (for now).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The bot is here:

   </a>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Thanks again to Orphis for providing this nice service!
   <br/>
