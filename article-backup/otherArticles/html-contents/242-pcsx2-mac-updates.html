   , came back with a bang after some time of silence! He has released a new version of his 0.9.6 port of PCSX2 for Lion with some additional compatibility fixes. Here is what he had to say about it:

   m releasing a slightly updated version of pcsx2 0.9.6  it should crash less because of the audio plugin. 0.9.7 is proving very difficult so no update for now.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   From this version onwards this becomes a regular .dmg bundle with pcsx2.app separated from the required libraries package  which is still included in the dmg by default.
   <br/>
   You can get it from Downloads or direct link  pcsx2.dmg
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The package has been cleaned so that all libraries reside in /usr/local/pcsx2 and can be removed easily. The Uninstaller.pkg included in the dmg will do that for you.

   Latest version of XQuartz and CG framework still require

   In addition, he released an early 0.9.7 alpha port. This version should be considered unstable and pre-beta but you can give it a try. Here is what was posted about this:

   nd the day has come  Im releasing a very early alpha version of 0.9.7  it does play some games but you are advised to do a lot of save states.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Im going to continue working on this so hopefully will get better as the time goes on.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   You can grab it here: pcsx2 0.9.7.dmg
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The installer includes another mandatory package  WXWidgets.pkg which should be installed after Libraries.pkg. Note that Uninstaller.pkg is going to delete the whole install but otherwise 0.9.6 and 0.9.7 coexist well
