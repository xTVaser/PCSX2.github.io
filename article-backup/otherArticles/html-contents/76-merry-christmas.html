   It's already close to 2012 but here I am once more wishing on Christmas day to everyone following and using PCSX2!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   So we all wish you will get what you want (and wish even more it's a new PC so you can run PCSX2 better!!), have fun and enjoy these few days with your loved ones because that's what counts in the end.
   <br/>
   If you don't celebrate Christmas, Merry Sunday!
