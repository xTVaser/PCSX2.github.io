    A farewell from cottonvibes
   </a>
  </h2>
  <p>
   As of today I am officially retiring from the PCSX2 emulation project.
   <br/>
   I am being offered a great job opportunity which will not only utilize my programming skills, but will provide an environment which allows them to further grow and improve.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The decision to leave was not an easy one, and I would not leave the project for just any job, but this career opportunity is too good to let it slide.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   I have learned a great deal in my years coding for PCSX2, and I want to thank the team for allowing me to work with them on this great project.
   <br/>
   I hope the project continues to improve in my absence, and I look forward to the future PCSX2 v1.0 release.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   So to the PCSX2 team, thanks and good luck!
   <br/>
   And thank you to the users who appreciated my work.
