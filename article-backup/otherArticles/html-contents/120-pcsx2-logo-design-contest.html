    PCSX2 Logo Design Contest!
   </a>
  </h2>
  <p>
   As many people that actively check our SVN know, we are in the process of a completely new cross-platform GUI for PCSX2.
   <br/>
   But it would be quite dull to have a new GUI without a new logo, so we decided a fun thing to do would be to have a logo designing contest where people can show us their skills, and make the next official logo for PCSX2!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The contest rules are simple:
   <br/>
   - Due by June 5th, 2009, but users can submit entries early in the
   <a href="http://forums.pcsx2.net/Thread-PCSX2-Logo-Design-Entries?pid=37631" target="_blank">
    PCSX2 Logo Design Entries
   </a>
   thread.
   <br/>
   - The contest is free for anyone to enter, including people affiliated with the project.
   <br/>
   - You may enter as many entries as you like (though only one entry will be chosen.)
   <br/>
   - Winner will get their logo in our next release, and will be credited for their logo in our "about dialog."
   <br/>
   - Winner will be decided by PCSX2 team (in the event that the PCSX2 team likes our current logo better than the entries, we will have no winner)
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Logo restrictions:
   <br/>
   - Logo must contain the word 'PCSX2' (font/format/color is up to the designer)
   <br/>
   - Logo should be of reasonable size (our current logo is 380x180px, so size should be roughly similar)
   <br/>
   - Logo entry can be a modification of our current logo.
   <br/>
   - Logo should be submitted as a .png file.
   <br/>
   - You may submit an optional 64x64px Icon with your logo to be used as PCSX2's new icon (also should be a .png file).
   <br/>
   - All entries will be released under a Creative Commons license.
   <br/>
   -
   <span style="color: #ff0000;">
    No copyrighted images may be used in the entries.
   </span>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tip for Icons:
   <br/>
   * Icons should be 64x64, but
   <strong>
    must look good at 32x32 and 16x16
   </strong>
   . Explained:
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Typically users will see 32x32 or 16x16 versions of icons (these are shown in start menu, quick launch, etc). So for a 64x64 icon to be usable it
   <em>
    must
   </em>
   scale well to 32x32 or 16x16. Alternatively you can prepare an entire icon package, with special versions of an icon at each size: 64x64, 48x48, 32x32, and 16x16. This way you can ensure icons look as intended at each size.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   So good luck!
