     PSX:Memory card support

   OriginallyPSX memory card creation was not possible through the emulator and games could not see when a memory card was inserted. In addition, a hack has been added that allows PCSX2 to "view" PSX memory cards as a Pocketstation to fix compatibility with certain PSX games such as Final Fantasy VIII. More details on that addition can be found

   <br/>
   <br/>
   This change adds/enhances the following additions:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Adds a checkbox to the memory card creation screen allowing PSX cards to be created, as well as the logic for writing in tothe empty card.
   </li>
   <li>
    Modifying the existing preprocessor based SIO interrupts to instead work based on the running game's type (PSX/PS2). This allows PS2 games to skip the delays as they were before, but for PSX games to use the delays, which are necessary for memory card interaction.
   </li>
  </ul>

    Extend "Preload Frame Data" support to Direct3D
   </a>
   by
   <a href="https://github.com/lightningterror" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
    lightningterror
   </a>
   - This hack allows for the "Preload Frame Data" (that is currently present in the OpenGL renderer) to be used in D3D renderers. It is used to fix various effects that are currently broken or not rendered properly in D3D renderers.

   hack by

    lightningterror
   </a>
   - This hack enables 4-bit and 8-bit textures to be converted on the CPU instead of the GPU. It will fix glitches in games that use these types of textures.
