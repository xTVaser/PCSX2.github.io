   A massive improvement on GSdx was done in Q2 2017 that we forgot to mention which improves the performance on both hardware and software mode around 1-15% give or take depending on the game and configuration. It's a bit technical so all we can say is that it improves performance but if anyone wishes to read the more technical stuff then it's best to checkout the Pull Request on GitHub.

   Akash also updated the texture cache that fixed/improved a few issues as well as solved a couple of regressions. These changes should help with improving emulation accuracy on native and upscaled resolutions.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Fix the load size calculation in target update.
   </li>
   <li>
    Add an optional macro (ENABLE_ACCURATE_BUFFER_EMULATION) for enabling more accurate emulation of the buffer size.
   </li>
   <li>
    Fixed a regression that caused many games to crash with custom resolutions (Gran Turismo series, Silent Hill series, Persona series, Metal Gear Solid series and others as well).
   </li>
   <li>
    Fixed a regression on Beyond Good And Evil that exhibited FMV flickering.

      GSdx: Texture Shuffle port to Direct3D

  <p>
   Previously texture shuffle only worked if CRC hack level was below full since it was in beta stage. lightningterror did the testing, adjusted the code and properly ported it without relying on the CRC hack level. This will fix glitchy graphics (green/brown vertical lines sometimes) on games that make use of the same effect.
   <br/>
   The Godfather, Urban Chaos, 50 Cent Bulletproof, Metal Gear solid series,God of War series, Final Fight Streetwise,The Suffering Ties that Bind,Sengoku Basara and many others.
  </p>
  <p>
   <br/>
   Note that texture shuffle is only supported by Direct3D10/11, however a partial port has been done for Direct3D9 as well. Direct3D 9 will skip some of the bad draw calls but the screen may still look a bit glitchy on some games. I guess better than nothing
   <img alt="Smile" class="yvSmiley" height="20" src="https://pcsx2.net/images/stories/frontend/smilies/smile.gif" width="20"/>
  </p>
  <p>
   Here are some example comparisons on Direct3D11.
  </p>
  <p>
   1.Sengoku Basara.
  </p>
  <p>
   2.50 Cent Bulletproof.

      GSdx: Channel Shuffle improvements on Direct3D

  <p>
   A small adjustment has been made in the channel shuffle detection on Direct3D, a lot of games should see an improvement where the top left corner issue has been resolved /improved.
  </p>
  <p>
   Metal Gear Solid series, Urban Chaos, Stolen and possibly other games that use the effect are resolved/improved.
   <br/>
   Direct3D still misses the proper shaders to emulate the effect and need to be ported from OpenGL one day but it's a nice improvement for users that don't use OpenGL.
  </p>
  <p>
   It's worth keeping in mind just like before the channel shuffle effect only skips the bad draw calls so it kinda works like a CRC hack just somewhat better since it only skips the channel shuffle draw calls and not any other post processing effects.

  <ul>
   <li>
    List of added CRC hacks:
    <ul>
     <li>
      Final Fight Streetwise - One hack added.

  </ul>
  <p>
   There have been more changes such as moving some CRC hacks to Aggressive state that can be used as speedhacks, some moved to Direct3D only but the list will be quite big if we include everything, all the other changes can be viewed on GitHub.
  </p>
  <p>
   The CRC hack code was also cleaned up a bit, many games (prequels/sequels) shared code, which has now been merged making it more compact, readable and cleaner.

   Previously, the DVD variant NTSC/PAL modes used the horizontal blanking interval calculation algorithm used by digital video modes, which shouldn't be used and also the rounding error check was neglected. Added the DVD variant modes to the list in analog video mode finder subroutine. This should impact timing/vertical synchronization in PSX games significantly.
  </p>
  <p>
   So far the only affected PSX title isLego Rock Raiders' which has the graphic corruptions resolved.
