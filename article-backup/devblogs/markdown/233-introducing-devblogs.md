Today marks the start of a new section called **Blog** , this is an area
for the development team to write technical articles and day-to-day
happenings. This is something we hope you find an interesting read, and
a general resource for technical information with an insight into the
PCSX2 team.  
  
You will find entries about on a variety of subjects, including
technical articles, site development, humorous aspects of working on a
project such as this and the 'technical challenges' that are met every
day.  
  
You may of gathered that this blogs section will not be a 'light read',
such as the primary news section. Blogs are aimed at the technically
minded, though I dare say there shall be light hearted entries . Due to
the technical nature of this blogs section, the forums will not be
supporting general questions relating to blog entries.
