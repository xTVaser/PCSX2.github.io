<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> As of **Sept 30th** , we've re-enabled
user comments at our SVN repository ( [PCSX2 @
Googlecode](http://code.google.com/p/pcsx2/) ). </span>  
  
Comments have been re-enabled primarily so that we can get user feedback
again on plugins and the current ***legacy gui*** updates. The trunk of
svn (the new wx gui) is still too volatile for user comments to be of
much use, so don't be surprised if we pretty well blow off "bug reports"
relating to it.  
  
*(and yes, top priorities for implementation in the new gui are
framelimiter, savestates, and the advanced cpu options -- along with bug
fixes and memory leak fixes. No timeframe estimates: They'll all get
done when they get done!)*
