It\'s been a while since the last site improvements, however this time
we have some nice and maybe unique features on our site.\
\
Our compatibility page has been upgraded. The new feature is the AJAX
powered toggle boxes which allow you to see games with a particular
status.\
The status will be remembered when switching between pages.\
