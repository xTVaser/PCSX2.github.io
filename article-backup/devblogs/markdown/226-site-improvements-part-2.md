It's been a while since the last site improvements, however this time we
have some nice and maybe unique features on our site.  
  
Our compatibility page has been upgraded. The new feature is the AJAX
powered toggle boxes which allow you to see games with a particular
status.  
The status will be remembered when switching between pages.
