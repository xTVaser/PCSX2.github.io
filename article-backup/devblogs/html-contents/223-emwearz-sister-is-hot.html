     Emwearz
    </span>
   </a>
   has a really sexy sister. She's an up and coming model, and would like to do some promo shoots wearing a specially made PCSX2 t-shirt and her favorite white thong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However we've run into a snag,
   <strong>
    emwearz
   </strong>
   doesn't want his sister doing such photo shoots, especially when they would be wet t-shirt and highly provocative (think FHM / Maxim style). Hence we need you the viewer!!!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Edit: Forgive CKemu,it's that time of the month again...(and don't edit my edits!)
   <br/>

   <strong>
    PM EMWEARZ
   </strong>
   via the NGemu forums

   <strong>
    promised
   </strong>
   to let his sister do this photo shoot!
