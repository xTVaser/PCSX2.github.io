   Today marks the start of a new section called
   <strong>
    Blog
   </strong>
   , this is an area for the development team to write technical articles and day-to-day happenings. This is something we hope you find an interesting read, and a general resource for technical information with an insight into the PCSX2 team.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   You will find entries about on a variety of subjects, including technical articles, site development, humorous aspects of working on a project such as this and the 'technical challenges' that are met every day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   You may of gathered that this blogs section will not be a 'light read', such as the primary news section. Blogs are aimed at the technically minded, though I dare say there shall be light hearted entries . Due to the technical nature of this blogs section, the forums will not be supporting general questions relating to blog entries.
