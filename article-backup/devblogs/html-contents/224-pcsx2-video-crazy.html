    PCSX2
   </strong>
   is perhaps one of the few projects that releases a constant series of videos demonstrating development progress, and whilst I'm not 100% sure on this, I believe the only emulator to have had two "promo" videos demonstrating that yes indeed, PS2 emulation is possible!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   These videos are delivered to you via
   <strong>
    Bit Torrent
   </strong>
   on our
   <a href="/demo-videos-screenshots/videos.html">
    videos page
   </a>
   , which for an emulation site is somewhat unique. In fact so "odd", I've had emails asking me if the use of Bit Torrent is legal, surprisingly Bit Torrent can and is used for legal distribution!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   You might wonder why such "promo" videos are made, it's somewhat unorthodox, well aside from the fact they are good fun to make, they serve to demonstrate what this project is doing as many people still don't believe that this is even possible!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   How are these videos made? Simple!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   When using
   <em>
    zeroGS
   </em>
   you merely have to press
   <strong>
    F7
   </strong>
   to start recording to your preferred codec, you then press F7 to stop recording, at this point you can just quit the emulator and marvel at your video, or you can keep playing! Press F7 again to add more footage to your video, and again press F7 to stop recording, this will produce one video based on where you stop/start recording.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <em>
    zeroGS
   </em>
   automatically speeds up footage to "normal" speeds, which causes issues if you want to record audio in sync with the video footage.
   <em>
    P.E.Op.S SPU2 DSound Driver
   </em>
   records at "emulated" speed and if the recording was muxed with the video recording, it would be significantly out of sync.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, you can get around this issue by disabling MTGS / DC modes from the CPU settings dialog, and setting
   <em>
    P.E.Op.S SPU2 DSound Driver
   </em>
   to
   <strong>
    Thread Mode
   </strong>
   . To
   <em>
    ensure
   </em>
   sync with the video, set
   <em>
    P.E.Op.S SPU2 DSound Driver
   </em>
   to start recording
   <strong>
    before
   </strong>
   you confirm the codec you wish to record with.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   You then can put the audio and video streams together in your preferred video editing software, for simple tasks like this I recommend

    VirtualDub
   </a>
   .
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The ability to record video directly from a PS2 game has significant benefits over camcorder or TV card recording as you can get fantastic quality at higher resolutions than the PS2 can natively output.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For the gaming enthusiast it lends itself nicely to demonstrating how kick-ass you are at a game, or lets you demonstrate secret areas, advanced combos.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <a href="http://www.youtube.com">
    YouTube
   </a>
   obviously offers a space to share such videos, and many people from all over the world already show fantastic videos from PCSX2, even the team use YouTube as a low bandwidth option to our high quality torrented videos.
   <br/>

   is also used by some testers to demonstrate intermediate work, and this videos are normally only shown on the
   <a href="http://forums.pcsx2.net" target="_blank">
    official forums
   </a>
   as a bonus to our forum browsers, an example of this would be the following video demonstrating
