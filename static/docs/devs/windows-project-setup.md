# Windows Project Setup

This guide is a WIP. It will eventually explain to users how to setup the PCSX2 repository on their PC, that's it. I know there's already a page on the wiki, but there should really be something up front that's integrated into the repo.

## Required Build Applications

<!-- MS has a handy list with names here https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/workload-component-id-vs-build-tools?view=vs-2019 -->
* [Visual Studio Community](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/)
  * Installing just the "Desktop development with C++" workload should be enough, otherwise select individually:
    * C++ ATL for v142 build tools (x86 & x64)
    * MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C++ x64/x86 build tools
    * Windows 10 SDK
* [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
